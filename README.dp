### Module 3. Testing Quadratic Equation

Write and cover with tests a method that solves a quadratic equation.

##### Method specification

For the given quadratic equation coefficients (ax2 + bx + c = 0) return array with zero, one or two real roots
    of the equation. Roots in the array may be in any order. Specify behavior of infinite roots case by yourself.

##### Tests specification:

- Ensure that method works fine in general cases:
  - two existing roots
  - one exiting root
  - no roots
- Ensure method works correctly if some of coefficients equal zero
- Ensure method works correctly in special cases (like when all coefficients are zeros)

##### Steps:

- Complete the method
- Complete the tests (Tests may go first - TDD)
